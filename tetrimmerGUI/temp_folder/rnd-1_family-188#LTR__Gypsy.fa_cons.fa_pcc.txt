RT catalyzes DNA replication from an RNA template, and is responsible for the replication of retroelements. An RT gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. RTs are present in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and Caulimoviruses.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals. RNase H inhibitors have been explored as an anti-HIV drug target because RNase H inactivation inhibits reverse transcription.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.

Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.

Members of this group are chromodomains or chromo shadow domains; these are SH3-fold-beta-barrel domains of the chromo-like superfamily. Chromodomains lack the first strand of the SH3-fold-beta-barrel, this first strand is altered by insertion in the chromo shadow domains. The chromodomain is a conserved region of about 50 amino acids, found in a variety of chromosomal proteins, and which appears to play a role in the functional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus. The chromodomain is implicated in the binding, of the proteins in which it is found, to methylated histone tails and maybe RNA. Chromodomain-containing proteins include: i) those having an N-terminal chromodomain followed by a related chromo shadow domain, such as Drosophila and human heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1), and mammalian modifier 1 and 2; ii) those having a single chromodomain, such as Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc), mammalian modifier 3, human Mi-2 autoantigen, and several yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins of unknown function; iii) those having paired tandem chromodomains, such as mammalian DNA-binding/helicase proteins CHD-1 to CHD-4 and yeast protein CHD1; (iv) and elongation factor eEF3, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, that serves an essential function in the translation cycle of fungi. eEF3 is a soluble factor lacking a transmembrane domain and having two ABC domains arranged in tandem, with a unique chromodomain inserted within the ABC2 domain.
